# Previously in data types we have seen that anything enclosed in quotes is a string.
# There are three types of quotes that can be used to define a string.
# Strings are immutable in Python, which means that once a string is created, it cannot be changed.
# But you can assign a new value to the same variable.

name = "Mustafa"
name = 'Mustafa'
name = '''Mustafa'''  # This is a multiline string and can be used to define a string that spans multiple lines.such as:

# This is a multiline string
poem = '''Twinkle, twinkle, little star,   
How I wonder what you are!
Up above the world so high,
Like a diamond in the sky.'''
